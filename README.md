# InsightLens: Multi-Layer Static Image Analysis System (In Development)

[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Training-orange)](https://github.com/vinhatson/insightlens)

**InsightLens** is an AI system under development, designed to analyze static images in high-stakes scenarios, identifying systemic roles and social ritual meanings through facial expressions, posture, and context at a fixed temporal snapshot.

## Project Status

InsightLens is currently in the training phase and not yet complete. The system is being developed to process visual data for systemic significance, such as ritual de-symbolization, by analyzing synchronization or divergence in expressions, posture, and context.

### Current Progress
- **Training Stage**: The AI is being trained on curated datasets of high-stakes images (e.g., corporate scandals, public arrests) to detect fine-grained visual cues, such as facial muscle tension (e.g., 3mm forehead tension) and posture angles (e.g., 20-degree head tilt).
- **Modules in Development**:
  - Facial and postural analysis: Mapping muscle coordination (e.g., orbicularis oculi) and eye divergence (e.g., +30% depth) to systemic roles.
  - Context analysis: Identifying neutral vs. symbolic environments (e.g., absence of legal symbols).
  - Systemic ritual modeling: Linking visual data to economic and social impacts (e.g., market stabilization signals).
- **Challenges**: Training requires specialized datasets and expertise in body language and mathematical modeling, which are being actively refined.
- **Next Steps**: Expand dataset diversity, optimize vector synchronization algorithms, and finalize integration with contextual data sources.

## Demo Outputs

Below are preliminary outputs showcasing InsightLens’s capabilities, based on two case studies processed during training.

### Bernard Ebbers Arrest (2002)

**Input**:  
- **Image**: Ebbers during an arrest, showing a slight smile (lip corners raised 5mm, eye corners narrowed 2mm), eyes tilted upward 15 degrees, upright posture with open shoulders (shoulder angle: 0 degrees deviation), context with camera flashes and press crowd.  
- **Context**: Collapse of a major telecommunications corporation, early 2000s financial crisis, U.S. financial markets.

**InsightLens Report**:

> **Systemic Analysis: Bernard Ebbers – Public Justice Ritual**  
> **Expression and Posture**:  
> - Face: Slight smile with lip corners raised 5mm, eye corners narrowed 2mm, facial muscle coordination at 92%.  
> - Eyes: Tilted upward 15 degrees, eyelid aperture at 70%, synchronized with smile (divergence: 3%).  
> - Posture: Upright stance, open shoulders (shoulder angle: 0 degrees deviation), head centered (tilt: 2 degrees), muscle tension at 12%.  
>  
> **Context**:  
> - Environment: Camera flashes (1500 lux) and press crowd, with 60% frame area for media.  
> - Absences: No legal symbols (symbol index: 0.45).  
> - Interactions: No secondary figures (subject area ratio: 80%).  
>  
> **Systemic Role**:  
> - Ebbers acts as a responsibility focal point, redirecting scrutiny from systemic flaws to an individual.  
> - Ritual: Public justice, with synchronized expression and posture forming a "controlled antagonist" image (public shaping index: 0.85).  
> - Social Impact: Reduces unrest (protest index: -60%).  
> - Economic Impact: Signals capital flow stabilization (+15% over 12 months).  

**Technical Notes**:  
Training focuses on synchronizing facial vectors (92%) to map to systemic roles, with ongoing refinement for media context detection.

### Person A Arrest in Country B (2022)

**Input**:  
- **Image**: A in a meeting room, face with muscles drawn backward (lips closed, forehead tensed 3mm), head tilted downward 20 degrees, shoulders slumped (shoulder angle: 10 degrees deviation), eyes deeper than facial vector (eyelid aperture: 60%), a secondary figure with hair covering 50% of face and hand lightly placed (elbow angle: 30 degrees), no handcuffs, context with pale wooden wall, water bottle, conference furniture.  
- **Context**: Financial scandal in country B, 2022 stock market, public sentiment.

**InsightLens Report**:

> **Systemic Analysis: Person A – Ritual De-Symbolization**  
> **Expression and Posture**:  
> - Face: Muscles drawn backward (lips closed, forehead tensed 3mm), coordination at 95%.  
> - Eyes: Eyelid aperture at 60%, diverging from facial vector (depth: +30%).  
> - Posture: Head tilted downward (angle: 20 degrees), shoulders slumped (shoulder angle: 10 degrees deviation), muscle tension at 8%.  
>  
> **Context**:  
> - Environment: Pale wooden wall, water bottle, conference furniture (lighting: 500 lux), symbol index at 0.05.  
> - Absences: No handcuffs or legal symbols (neutrality index: 0.90).  
> - Interactions: Secondary figure with hair covering 50% of face, occupying 20% frame area.  
>  
> **Systemic Role**:  
> - A serves as a symbol erased from country B’s economic system, preventing public polarization.  
> - Ritual: De-symbolization, with synchronized posture and neutral context creating a "negative emotional geometry" (public shaping index: 0.88).  
> - Social Impact: Suppresses unrest (protest index: -70%).  
> - Economic Impact: Signals market stabilization (+10% over 6 months).  

**Technical Notes**:  
Training emphasizes eye divergence detection (+30%) and neutral context modeling, with improvements needed for secondary figure analysis.

## Donation for Source Code Access

InsightLens is a work in progress, and I’m training the AI to refine its ability to decode systemic rituals from images. To support this effort and gain access to the source code upon completion, I’m offering the code to donors:

- **Donation Amount**: $5,151 USD.
- **What You Get**: Once training is complete, donors will receive a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file containing the full source code and deployment documentation.
- **How to Donate**: Contact me for payment details (USDT TRC-20 preferred).
- **Delivery**: Code will be sent to all donors upon project completion, estimated within 6–12 months, depending on dataset sourcing and model optimization.

Your donation will fuel the acquisition of specialized datasets and the development of mathematical models for ritual analysis.

## Ethical Considerations

InsightLens is designed with ethical principles:
- **Data Privacy**: Uses only publicly available images, with data deletion post-analysis.
- **Cultural Neutrality**: Accounts for cultural context to ensure unbiased outputs.
- **Misuse Prevention**: Limited to systemic analysis, prohibiting personal defamation.
